You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #.

Compiled languages examine your entire program at compile time, and are able to warn you about a whole class of errors prior to execution. In contrast, Python interprets your script line by line as it executes it. Python will stop executing the entire program when it encounters an error (unless the error is expected and handled by the programmer, a more advanced subject that we’ll cover later on in this course). # Check the Python Version import sys print(sys.version) ## 3.10.3 (v3.10.3:a342a49189, Mar 16 2022, 09:34:18) [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)] [Tip:] sys is a built-in module that contains many system-specific parameters and functions, including the Python version in use. Before using it, we must explicitly import it. 2.1 Types of objects in Python Python is an object-oriented language. There are many different types of objects in Python. Let’s start with the most common object types: strings, integers and floats. Anytime you write words (text) in Python, you’re using character strings (strings for short). The most common numbers, on the other hand, are integers (e.g. -1, 0, 100) and floats, which represent real numbers (e.g. 3.14, -42.0). Object Types integer = 10 float = 10.1 string = “Hello” boolean = True float to integer a = 10.123 type(a) ## &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt; b = int(a) b ## 10 type(b) ## &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; numeric to string a_string = str(a) a_string ## &#39;10.123&#39; string to numeric float(&quot;1.1&quot;) ## 1.1 it does not transform directly to integer here int(&quot;1.123&quot;) but it works when transforming to float then integer. int(float(&quot;10.123&quot;)) boolean bl = True bl ## True type(bl) ## &lt;class &#39;bool&#39;&gt; boolean to numeric True becomes 1 int(bl) ## 1 numeric to boolean 0 becomes False all other numbers are True bool(-100) ## True bool(0) ## False 2.2 Expressions: Mathematical Operations 5 + 5 * 10 - 2 / 5 ## 54.6 integer division 11 // 2 ## 5 modulo: remainder 10 % 3 ## 1 2.3 String Operations -string object are in single quote or double quote 2.3.1 Indices Positive Index In python indices start with 0 In R indices start with 1 Negative Index -1 corresponds to the last element myname = &quot;Davut Emrah Ayan&quot; print(&quot;Object myname:&quot;, myname) # examples ## Object myname: Davut Emrah Ayan print(myname[0], &#39;is the first element of myname object&#39;) ## D is the first element of myname object print(myname[6], &#39;is the 6th element of myname object&#39;) ## E is the 6th element of myname object print(myname[-1], &#39;is the last element of myname object&#39;) ## n is the last element of myname object 2.3.2 Slicing Full version object[from : to : increment] print(&quot;Object:&quot;, myname) ## Object: Davut Emrah Ayan print(&quot;From 0 index to 5th index, by 1, is&quot;, myname[0:5:1]) ## From 0 index to 5th index, by 1, is Davut Short version print(&quot;Object myname:&quot;, myname) ## Object myname: Davut Emrah Ayan print(myname[0:5], &quot;is the first 5 element of the object&quot;) ## Davut is the first 5 element of the object Shorter version Numeric string is easier to see. num = &quot;0123456789&quot; print(num[::2], &quot;every 2 other element&quot;) ## 02468 every 2 other element print(num[::3], &quot;every 3 other element&quot;) ## 0369 every 3 other element print(num[::4], &quot;every 4 other element&quot;) ## 048 every 4 other element print(num[::5], &quot;every 5 other element&quot;) ## 05 every 5 other element Length of an object : len() it is character length or element length len(myname) ## 16 2.3.3 Concatenate statement = &quot;KU&quot; + &quot; is the best!&quot; statement ## &#39;KU is the best!&#39; myname[0:5] + &quot; is the best!&quot; ## &#39;Davut is the best!&#39; Multiplication with strings myname[0:6] * 3 ## &#39;Davut Davut Davut &#39; Strings are Immutable "],["pandas-library.html", "Chapter 3 Pandas Library 3.1 read data 3.2 Explore Data", " Chapter 3 Pandas Library run pip3 install pandas on rstudio terminal or mac terminal or jupyter notebook 3.1 read data import pandas as pd pd.set_option(&#39;display.max_columns&#39;, None) 3.1.1 csv file IBM sample data: I could not run with “https” because I did not have a certificate installed.
